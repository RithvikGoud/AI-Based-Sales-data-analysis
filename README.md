# AI Based Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
**AI Based Sales Data Analysis** focuses on analyzing the sales patterns and performance of a Superstore using AI techniques. The goal is to understand trends, product category performance, regional variations, and predict future sales.

## Features

### Feature Engineering:
- **Identify relevant features** that could impact sales, like trend or seasonality.
- Investigate **sales patterns** for different product categories (Increasing or decreasing over years).
- Analyze the **correlation between sales** and other variables within each category.

### Regional Analysis:
- Explore **regional variations in sales**, such as by state or city.
- Identify **factors contributing to sales differences** across regions.

### Predictive Modeling:
- Develop a **machine learning model** (e.g., regression, time series forecasting) to predict future sales.
- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (like Time complexity).

### Visualization:
- Create **visualizations** to represent temporal trends, product category insights, and regional variations.
- Use **visualizations** to communicate findings effectively.
